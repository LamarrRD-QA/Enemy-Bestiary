                        Welcome to this website. This is a fan page dedicated to the enemies of the Mario & Luigi series
                        and their random properties.
                        Due to the recent downfall of AlphaDream (the developers behind the series), I have decided to
                        compile a list of all the enemies
                        that you would see adventuring through the many lovely games. You will be able to see the stats
                        associated with the enemy, any potential weaknesses and strengths that they may have, potential
                        locations to find them at and the chances of getting items after they've been defeated. I hope
                        you enjoy reading through the bestiary as much as I loved documenting them and maybe you might
                        find something that amazes you. Click the button below to start or search for an enemy at the
                        top.
